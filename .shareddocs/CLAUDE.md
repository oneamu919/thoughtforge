Read this first. It tells you what exists, what's done, and what's not.

## MANDATORY: Session Handoff

**Before your session ends, you MUST update this file.** This is how the next AI coder knows where you left off. If you don't update it, the next coder wastes time re-auditing the entire project.

Update these sections before closing out:
1. **Current Status** — mark what you completed, what's still not done
2. **Last Session** — replace the entry below with what you did
3. If you created new files or modules, add them to the **Module Map** or **Key Paths**
4. If you learned a gotcha, add it to `docs/lessons-learned.md` (next lesson number in sequence)
5. Commit this file with your other changes. Do not leave it uncommitted.
6. **Push after each commit.** It's OK to push frequently — the human can always roll back with `git revert` or `git reset`. If you made a mistake, fix it and push the fix. Never leave commits unpushed without the human knowing. Before closing out, confirm everything is pushed.
