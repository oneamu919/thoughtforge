**Summary:** 0 Critical, 3 Major, 14 Minor findings across the three documents. The plan is thorough and well-cross-referenced. The major gaps are behavioral omissions (post-completion rejection path, fix history awareness, acceptance test coverage validation) rather than structural problems. The minor findings are mostly clarity improvements and two missing execution plan tasks (graceful shutdown, fix regression guard).
