**Summary:** 3 Major findings, 10 Minor findings, 0 Critical findings. The plan is buildable as-is ΓÇö none of the findings would block a competent developer from starting. The two structural Majors (Phase 3ΓåÆ4 transition error handling and action button UI behavior) are the most important to address before build because they'll generate questions from whoever implements Tasks 6c and 10. The connector URL handling Major will generate questions during Task 8. Everything else is clarity improvements.
