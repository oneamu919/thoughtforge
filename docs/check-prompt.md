Read these files:
results.md

Based on what you read, do these project files still need updates or not?

The convergence criteria is: 0 critical findings, fewer than 3 major findings, fewer than 5 minor findings. If the review meets that criteria, updates are not necessary. If it does not, updates are still needed.

Write your answer in this format:
- result: true or false (true = still needs updates, false = no updates needed)
- Your counts of critical, major, and minor findings
- One sentence explaining your reasoning

If result is true, extract the consolidated prompt block from results.md and create or overwrite the file apply-prompt.md with that content. The apply-prompt.md file MUST exist on disk before you finish. If no consolidated prompt block exists in results.md, do NOT fabricate one — instead write your output as: result: error — review output is missing the consolidated prompt block

If result is false, do not modify apply-prompt.md.
