I've read both documents. The review itself contains a summary in `resultsbool.md` that tallies the findings:

- **Critical:** 1 (threshold: 0)
- **Major:** 6 (threshold: fewer than 3)
- **Minor:** 5 (threshold: fewer than 5)

**result: true** GÇö the project files still need updates. All three severity categories exceed convergence criteria (1 critical where 0 allowed, 6 major where fewer than 3 allowed, 5 minor where fewer than 5 allowed), so the documents require further revision.
