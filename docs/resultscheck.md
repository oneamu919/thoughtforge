Done. Here's my assessment:

- **result: true** ΓÇö still needs updates
- **Critical: 1** (missing `intent.md` template/structure definition)
- **Major: 4** (Code Mode iteration cycle wording, Plan Completeness Gate identification, WebSocket reconnection strategy, concurrency enforcement mechanism)
- **Minor: 11** (7 clarity replacements + 4 extraction/addition items)
- All three convergence thresholds are exceeded (critical >= 1, major >= 3, minor >= 5), so updates are still needed.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written to disk with explicit instructions for every replacement, addition, and extraction from the findings.
