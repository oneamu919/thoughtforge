Done. Here's the summary:

- **result: true** ΓÇö still needs updates
- **Critical: 1** | **Major: 8** | **Minor: 5**
- The review fails convergence criteria on both critical (1 vs threshold of 0) and major (8 vs threshold of fewer than 3), so updates are still needed.

`apply-prompt.md` has been replaced with the full 14-change consolidated prompt from `apply-prompt-r3.md`.
