**result: true** — the project files still need updates.

**Finding counts:**
- Critical: 1 (empty Acceptance Criteria at Phase 2 confirm — no validation gate)
- Major: 4 (VK toggle mid-project, polish_state.json corruption handling, test command discovery contract, missing chat URL scanning task)
- Minor: 14 (8 clarity replacements + 6 missing/extraction items)

All three severity categories exceed their convergence thresholds (0 critical, <3 major, <5 minor), so further updates are required.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with 18 explicit changes mapping every finding from results.md to specific files, with exact find/replace text and insertion points.
