**result: true** — still needs updates

- **Critical:** 1 (Code mode `safety-rules.js` policy undefined)
- **Major:** 6 (Fix Regression wording, critical path chain, concurrency clarification, `task_queue.json` schema, Code mode test file detection, `tsx` missing from dependencies)
- **Minor:** 8 (constraints.md language, parallelism note, config.yaml comment, Telegram placeholder, git commit format, Levenshtein decision, task queue unit test, plus 2 extraction items)

The review fails all three convergence thresholds (needs 0 critical/got 1, needs <3 major/got 6, needs <5 minor/got 8). `apply-prompt.md` has been written with all 16 changes mapped to their target files with exact replacement/addition text.
