Done. Here's the summary:

- **result: true** — still needs updates
- **Critical: 0 | Major: 3 | Minor: 7**
- The review exceeds convergence thresholds on both major (3, need <3) and minor (7, need <5) findings, so updates are still required.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with 10 explicit changes mapping every non-withdrawn finding from results.md to its target file, with exact find/replace text and insertion instructions.
