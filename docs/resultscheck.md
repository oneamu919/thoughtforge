**result: true** ΓÇö still needs updates.

- **Critical:** 0
- **Major:** 3 (button debounce, disk management/project cleanup, server restart behavior)
- **Minor:** 14 (7 unclear writing replacements + 4 missing minor content items + 3 extraction items)

The review fails convergence on both major findings (3, need <3) and minor findings (14, need <5), so updates are still required.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written to disk with explicit instructions for all 17 changes (7 replacements, 7 additions, 3 extractions) mapped to their target files, plus a final git commit and push step.
