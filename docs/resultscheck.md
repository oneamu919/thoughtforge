It looks like write permissions keep getting denied. Let me provide my assessment while you decide on the file write.

## Assessment

- **result: true** ΓÇö still needs updates
- **Critical: 0 | Major: 5 | Minor: 8**
- The review passes on critical (0 = 0), but fails on major (5 >= 3) and minor (8 >= 5), so updates are still required to bring the project below the convergence thresholds.

The consolidated coder prompt is the block from `results.md` lines 223-421 (inside the "Consolidated Coder Prompt" code fence). It contains 14 changes across 4 files. I've been trying to write it to `apply-prompt.md` but the write permission is being denied ΓÇö could you approve the file write permission so I can complete that step?
