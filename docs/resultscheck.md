**result: true** — still needs updates.

**Findings count:**
- Critical: 1
- Major: 4
- Minor: 13

The review does not meet convergence criteria (requires 0 critical, <3 major, <5 minor). With 1 critical finding (no spec for human chat during autonomous execution), 4 major findings (fix agent context assembly, AC validation gate error handling, mid-processing input queuing task, plan fix output validation task), and 13 minor findings across clarity, missing content, and build-spec extraction issues, updates are still needed.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with all 17 changes mapped to their target files with exact replacement text.
