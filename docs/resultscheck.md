The file contains a summary line but I need to verify it has the actual structured findings (three numbered lists). Let me read more carefully — the file may be truncated or short.

The file is only 3 lines long. It contains a summary but **does not contain the three numbered lists** of findings (Critical, Major, Minor structured as separate lists).

Wait — let me re-read the instructions. The check is whether results.md contains "actual structured findings (the three numbered lists)." This file has only a summary paragraph, not numbered lists of findings.

**result: error** — results.md does not contain valid review output. It contains only a summary line without the expected three numbered lists of structured findings (Critical, Major, Minor).
