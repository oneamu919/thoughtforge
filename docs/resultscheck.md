**result: true** — still needs updates

- Critical: 0
- Major: 3 (package.json dependencies, context window definition, graceful shutdown for concurrent projects)
- Minor: 11 (guard evaluation order, Phase 2 steps clarity, stagnation guard precision, task queue persistence contradiction, Phase 3 completeness wording, critical path correction, HTTP API surface, CORS/static serving, plan plugin discovery.js, halt_reason fix_regression, brain dump prompt extraction + button behavior annotation)

The review exceeds convergence thresholds on both major (3, threshold is <3) and minor (11, threshold is <5) findings. `apply-prompt.md` has been written with all 14 changes mapped to specific files and locations.
