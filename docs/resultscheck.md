- **result: true** — still needs updates
- **Critical: 0, Major: 2, Minor: 12**

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with explicit instructions for all 11 actionable findings (6 replacements + 5 additions), mapped to their target files with exact replacement/addition text. The 3 "no action" findings from Section 3 are noted as requiring no changes.
