**Result: true** — updates are still needed.

**Finding counts:**
- Critical: 0
- Major: 4
- Minor: 11

The review exceeds the convergence criteria on both major findings (4, threshold is <3) and minor findings (11, threshold is <5), so the project files still need updates. The `apply-prompt.md` file has been written to disk with 16 explicit changes mapped to their target files.
