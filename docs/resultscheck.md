The file has always been this short at the latest commit ΓÇö the consolidated prompt was never written into this version of `results.md`. The file itself claims "The consolidated AI coder prompt at the bottom of results.md has 14 changes" but that content is missing.

I need to construct the apply-prompt from the findings listed in `results.md`. But since the actual prompt text with find/replace instructions was never written, I can't "extract" something that doesn't exist.

Let me be transparent about this: **The consolidated prompt block referenced in line 19 of `results.md` does not actually exist in the file.** The file ends at line 20 with no prompt content below the summary.

I have two options:
1. Report that the prompt is missing and cannot be extracted
2. Generate the prompt from the findings

Since you asked me to "extract the complete block of text that is designated as the consolidated prompt," and that block does not exist in `results.md`, I cannot fulfill that part of the request. The file references 14 changes but only contains the summary of findings ΓÇö the actual prompt with find/replace instructions was never written.

**Would you like me to:**
- Generate a new apply-prompt from the 1 critical + 7 major + 7 minor findings listed in the summary, or
- Flag this to whatever agent produced `results.md` so it can re-run and actually write the prompt?
