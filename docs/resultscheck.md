Here's my evaluation:

- **result: true** ΓÇö still needs updates
- **Critical:** 0 | **Major:** 3 | **Minor:** 10
- The review fails convergence on both major findings (3, need fewer than 3) and minor findings (10, need fewer than 5), so the project files still require updates.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with all 13 changes (7 replacements, 6 additions, 0 extractions) mapped explicitly to their target files and locations.
