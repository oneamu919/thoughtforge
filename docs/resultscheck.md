Done. Here's the assessment:

- **result: true** ΓÇö still needs updates
- **Critical: 0** (pass), **Major: 3** (fail ΓÇö need <3), **Minor: 10** (fail ΓÇö need <5)
- Both major and minor counts exceed their convergence thresholds, so the source files require further changes.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with instructions addressing all 3 major findings by topic (Phase 3ΓåÆ4 transition error handling, action button UI behavior, connector URL handling) and directing the coder to identify and fix the 10 minor findings using the review criteria.
