Done. Here's the summary:

- **Result: true** ΓÇö updates are still needed
- **Critical: 0 | Major: 12 | Minor: 4**
- The 12 major findings far exceed the convergence threshold of fewer than 3 major, so another round of edits is required.

`apply-prompt.md` has been replaced with the 17-change consolidated prompt from round 6.
