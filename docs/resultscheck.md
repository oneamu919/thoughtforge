Done. Here's my assessment:

- **result: true** — still needs updates
- **Critical:** 1 (Fix Regression guard has no mechanism to obtain post-fix error counts within a single iteration)
- **Major:** 3 (missing test-fix cycle stuck detection task, missing `polish_state.json` initial state spec, missing Phase 2 validation gate details in Task 12)
- **Minor:** 13 (unclear wording, missing cross-references, redundant content, missing specifications, content that should be extracted to build spec)

All three convergence thresholds are exceeded (need 0 critical, <3 major, <5 minor), so updates are still needed.

`apply-prompt.md` has been written with 17 explicit changes mapping every finding to its target file, location, and exact replacement/addition text.
