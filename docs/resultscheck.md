Here's my evaluation:

- **result: true** — still needs updates
- **Critical: 1** (no Fix Regression Guard for Phase 4)
- **Major: 4** (missing prompt drafting guidelines, Phase 3 stuck recovery input flow unspecified, no graceful shutdown behavior, truncation algorithm details belong in build spec)
- **Minor: 12** (7 unclear writing issues + 5 missing minor content/extractions)
- **Reasoning:** The review exceeds convergence thresholds on both critical (1 > 0 allowed) and major (4 >= 3 allowed), so updates are still required.

`apply-prompt.md` has been overwritten with explicit instructions covering all 17 actionable findings across the three source files.
